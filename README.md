This is done on top of a react scaffold I have worked
with in past ,
I've added CRUD functionality with demo accounts as well .

You can access demo accounts code in ./client/src/utils .
You can access connection context code in ./client/src/context .

Warning for this project to run at its desired capacity needs more time and some api 
token integration from you .
However, main focus of this task is code , I've worked mostly on that .

You can refer to both client and web3 individual readme's for more details
